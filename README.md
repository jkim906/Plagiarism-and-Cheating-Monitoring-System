# Plagiarism and Cheating Monitoring System
Project Programmed with Matlab

• Programmed to compare how similar two documents are, using a technique known as winnowing to produce document fingerprints.
• Winnowing is an agricultural term for the process of separating wheat (the bits of the plant you want) from
chaff (the bits you don’t want).
• Rather than comparing an entire document against other documents, a more efficient approach is to calculate a fingerprint for each
document, which identifies key aspects (i.e., substrings) of that document. 
• We can then compare the document fingerprints rather than the documents themselves (which is much faster to do).
